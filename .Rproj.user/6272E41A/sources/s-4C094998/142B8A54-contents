# UCI-HAR Dataset Analysis

This repo contains the results of the assignment of the Coursera course `Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project` that requires to manipulate data dowloadable from  [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).    

## Output Requirements

The required outputs available from the repo are:

* the **R script** [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/Hitopian/UCI-HAR/blob/master/run_analysis.R) that transforms the original data into a "tidy data set"
* the **CodeBook** [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/Hitopian/UCI-HAR/blob/master/CodeBook.md) that describes any transformation that has been performed

## Data manipulation Requirements

The final "tidy dat set" is the last point of these requirements:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The script creates 5 tables named (tb1, ... tb5) related to the steps above.
